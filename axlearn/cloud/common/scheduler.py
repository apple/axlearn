"""Utilities to decide whether to schedule jobs according to resource constraints.

The main API is `JobScheduler`, which makes scheduling decisions based on a quota file (see
`quota.py`) and has `Scheduler` and `ProjectJobSorter` as children.

`Scheduler` takes run-or-not verdicts for each job, based on available resources, demands of each
job, per-project quotas, and the priorities of jobs within each project. It uses
`ResourceLimitCalculator` to compute per-project resource limits based on the total limit,
per-project quotas, and demands.

Job priorities with a project can be determined with `ProjectJobSorter`, which sorts the jobs
based on the user id, creation time, and resource demands.
