    Tiers can be used to express different reservation types, such as:
    1. Reserved quota: instances scheduled onto this tier are SLO backed.
    2. Reserved pre-emptible quota: instances scheduled onto this tier may be pre-empted, e.g. by
        defragmentation, machine repairs, or other events, but still belong to a reservation.
    3. On-demand quota: instances scheduled onto this tier are provisioned as capacity allows,

    We make some basic assumptions:
    1. Jobs can tolerate scheduling on any given tier.
    2. Tiers have an implicit priority order.
    3. Tiers should partition the full quota, i.e., they must be disjoint and add up to the full
        resources.
    4. Lower priority tiers can borrow from higher priority tiers.

    With these assumptions, scheduling proceeds as follows:
    1. Projects are ordered based on the ratio `cumulative project usage / project quota`, breaking
        ties by creation time of the job to-be-scheduled for each project (first come first serve).
        If there are multiple resource types, we take the max usage ratio across resource types.
    2. Within each project, jobs are assumed to be already ordered.
    3. A job-to-be-scheduled will greedily acquire resources starting from the highest priority tier
        to the lowest priority tier. Once its demands are met, it will be scheduled on the last
        (lowest priority) tier which contributed quota.
