    Typically, if tier does not match reservation, we may need to recreate the job. To avoid
    frequently restarting jobs which bounce between tiers, jobs scheduled on tier=0 but not using
    the reservation are allowed to continue running until pre-emption, after which point they can be
    recreated on the reservation.

    Args:
        tier: Current scheduling tier.
        reservation: Current reservation status.
        is_pending: Whether the job can be recreated with minimal impact to uptime.
