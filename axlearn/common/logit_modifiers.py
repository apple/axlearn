"""Functions for logit-to-logit transformations.

The top-k and top-p implementations borrow heavily from T5X in using binary search over
the space of float32 thresholds, enabling them to achieve benign scaling for large `k` and `p`
values. This is unlikely to be the fastest approach for small `k`, however it is fastest for most
values of `p`.
