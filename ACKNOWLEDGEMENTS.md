              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

	Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and

	original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
	and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
	following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not

	     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
	     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
	     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
	     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
	     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
	     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
	     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
	     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the

	     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-

	     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public

	     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
	     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to

	     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain

	     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,

	Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public
	License

	By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
	to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
	Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License ("Public
	License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
	contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
	acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
	such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
	making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
	conditions.

	Section 1 -- Definitions.

	  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
	     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
	     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
	     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
	     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
	     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
	     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
	     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
	     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

	  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
	     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
	     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

	  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
	     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
	     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
	     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
	     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
	     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
	     Rights.
	  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
	     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
	     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
	     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
	     agreements.

	  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
	     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
	     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

	  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
	     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
	     License.

	  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
	     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
	     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
	     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

	  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
	     under this Public License.

	  i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
	     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
	     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
	     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
	     file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
	     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
	     exchange.

	  j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
	     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
	     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
	     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
	     available to the public including in ways that members of the
	     public may access the material from a place and at a time
	     individually chosen by them.

	  k. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
	     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
	     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
	     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
	     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

	  l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
	     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

	Section 2 -- Scope.

	  a. License grant.

	       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
	          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
	          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
	          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

	            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
	               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

	            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
	               NonCommercial purposes only.

	       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
	          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
	          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
	          its terms and conditions.

	       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
	          6(a).

	       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
	          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
	          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
	          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
	          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
	          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
	          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
	          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
	          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
	          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
	          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

	       5. Downstream recipients.

	            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
	               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
	               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
	               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
	               Public License.

	            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
	               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
	               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
	               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
	               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
	               Material.

	       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
	          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
	          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
	          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
	          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
	          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

	  b. Other rights.

	       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
	          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
	          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
	          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
	          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
	          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
	          Rights, but not otherwise.

	       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
	          Public License.

	       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
	          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
	          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
	          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
	          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
	          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
	          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
	          purposes.

	Section 3 -- License Conditions.

	Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
	following conditions.

	  a. Attribution.

	       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
	          form), You must:

	            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
	               with the Licensed Material:

	                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
	                    Material and any others designated to receive
	                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
	                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
	                    designated);

	                ii. a copyright notice;

	               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

	                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
	                    warranties;

	                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
	                    extent reasonably practicable;

	            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
	               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

	            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
	               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
	               hyperlink to, this Public License.

	       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
	          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
	          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
	          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
	          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
	          information.

	       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
	          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
	          reasonably practicable.

	       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
	          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
	          Material from complying with this Public License.

	Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

	Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
	apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

	  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
	     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
	     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
	     only;

	  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
	     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
	     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
	     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

	  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
	     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

	For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
	replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
	Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

	Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

	  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
	     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
	     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
	     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
	     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
	     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
	     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
	     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

	  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
	     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
	     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
	     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
	     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
	     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
	     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
	     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

	  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
	     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
	     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
	     waiver of all liability.

	Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

	  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
	     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
	     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
	     terminate automatically.

	  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
	     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

	       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
	          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
	          violation; or

	       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

	     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
	     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
	     of this Public License.

	  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
	     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
	     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
	     will not terminate this Public License.

	  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
	     License.

	Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

	  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
	     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

	  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
	     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
	     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

	Section 8 -- Interpretation.

	  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
	     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
	     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
	     be made without permission under this Public License.

	  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
	     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
	     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
	     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
	     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
	     conditions.

	  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
	     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
	     Licensor.

	  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
	     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
	     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
	     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

	License

	By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
	to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
	Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License ("Public
	License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
	contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
	acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
	such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
	making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
	conditions.

	Section 1 -- Definitions.

	  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
	     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
	     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
	     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
	     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
	     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
	     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
	     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
	     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

	     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
	     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

	  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
	     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
	     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
	     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
	     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
	     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
	     Rights.
	  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
	     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
	     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
	     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
	     agreements.

	  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
	     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
	     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

	     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
	     License.

	     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
	     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
	     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

	  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
	     under this Public License.

	  i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
	     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
	     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
	     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
	     file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
	     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
	     exchange.

	  j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
	     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
	     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
	     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
	     available to the public including in ways that members of the
	     public may access the material from a place and at a time
	     individually chosen by them.

	  k. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
	     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
	     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
	     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
	     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

	  l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
	     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

	Section 2 -- Scope.

	  a. License grant.

	       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
	          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
	          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
	          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

	            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
	               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

	            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
	               NonCommercial purposes only.

	       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
	          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
	          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
	          its terms and conditions.

	       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
	          6(a).

	       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
	          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
	          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
	          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
	          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
	          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
	          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
	          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
	          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
	          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
	          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

	       5. Downstream recipients.

	            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
	               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
	               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
	               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
	               Public License.

	            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
	               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
	               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
	               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
	               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
	               Material.

	       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
	          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
	          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
	          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
	          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
	          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

	  b. Other rights.

	       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
	          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
	          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
	          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
	          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
	          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
	          Rights, but not otherwise.

	       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
	          Public License.

	       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
	          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
	          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
	          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
	          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
	          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
	          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
	          purposes.

	Section 3 -- License Conditions.

	Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
	following conditions.

	  a. Attribution.

	       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
	          form), You must:

	            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
	               with the Licensed Material:

	                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
	                    Material and any others designated to receive
	                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
	                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
	                    designated);

	                ii. a copyright notice;

	               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

	                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
	                    warranties;

	                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
	                    extent reasonably practicable;

	            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
	               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

	            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
	               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
	               hyperlink to, this Public License.

	       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
	          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
	          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
	          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
	          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
	          information.

	       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
	          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
	          reasonably practicable.

	       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
	          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
	          Material from complying with this Public License.

	Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

	Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
	apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

	  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
	     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
	     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
	     only;

	  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
	     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
	     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
	     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

	  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
	     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

	For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
	replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
	Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

	Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

	  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
	     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
	     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
	     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
	     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
	     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
	     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
	     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

	  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
	     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
	     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
	     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
	     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
	     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
	     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
	     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

	  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
	     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
	     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
	     waiver of all liability.

	Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

	  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
	     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
	     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
	     terminate automatically.

	  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
	     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

	       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
	          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
	          violation; or

	       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

	     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
	     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
	     of this Public License.

	  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
	     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
	     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
	     will not terminate this Public License.

	  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
	     License.

	Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

	  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
	     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

	  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
	     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
	     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

	Section 8 -- Interpretation.

	  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
	     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
	     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
	     be made without permission under this Public License.

	  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
	     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
	     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
	     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
	     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
	     conditions.

	  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
	     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
	     Licensor.

	  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
	     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
	     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
	     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

	negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

	other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.

	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and

	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and

	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.

	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.

	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

	          stating that You changed the files; and

	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and

	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.

	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.

	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

	          stating that You changed the files; and

	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and

	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.

	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
	does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
	Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
	other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
	information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
	warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
	terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
	disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the

	Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

	Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
	conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
	original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
	and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
	following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
	exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

	     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
	     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
	     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
	     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
	     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
	     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
	     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
	     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
	     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
	     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
	     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
	     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

	     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
	     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
	     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
	     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
	     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
	     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
	     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
	     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
	     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
	     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
	     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
	     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
	     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
	     respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
	     for the public:

	Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
	Public License

	By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
	to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
	("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be
	interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
	consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
	Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
	Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
	these terms and conditions.


	Section 1 -- Definitions.

	  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
	     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
	     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
	     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
	     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
	     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
	     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
	     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
	     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

	  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
	     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
	     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

	  c. BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
	     creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative
	     Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

	  d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
	     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
	     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
	     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
	     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
	     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
	     Rights.

	  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
	     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
	     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
	     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
	     agreements.

	  f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
	     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
	     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

	  g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name
	     of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this
	     Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.

	  h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
	     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
	     License.

	  i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
	     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
	     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
	     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

	  j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
	     under this Public License.

	  k. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
	     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
	     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
	     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
	     file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
	     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
	     exchange.

	  l. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
	     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
	     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
	     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
	     available to the public including in ways that members of the
	     public may access the material from a place and at a time
	     individually chosen by them.

	  m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
	     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
	     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
	     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
	     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

	  n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
	     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


	Section 2 -- Scope.

	  a. License grant.

	       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
	          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
	          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
	          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

	            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
	               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

	            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
	               NonCommercial purposes only.

	       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
	          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
	          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
	          its terms and conditions.

	       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
	          6(a).

	       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
	          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
	          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
	          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
	          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
	          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
	          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
	          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
	          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
	          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
	          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

	       5. Downstream recipients.

	            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
	               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
	               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
	               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
	               Public License.

	            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
	               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
	               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
	               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
	               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

	            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
	               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
	               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
	               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
	               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
	               Material.

	       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
	          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
	          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
	          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
	          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
	          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

	  b. Other rights.

	       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
	          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
	          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
	          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
	          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
	          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
	          Rights, but not otherwise.

	       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
	          Public License.

	       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
	          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
	          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
	          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
	          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
	          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
	          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
	          purposes.


	Section 3 -- License Conditions.

	Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
	following conditions.

	  a. Attribution.

	       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
	          form), You must:

	            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
	               with the Licensed Material:

	                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
	                    Material and any others designated to receive
	                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
	                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
	                    designated);

	                ii. a copyright notice;

	               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

	                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
	                    warranties;

	                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
	                    extent reasonably practicable;

	            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
	               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

	            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
	               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
	               hyperlink to, this Public License.

	       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
	          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
	          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
	          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
	          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
	          information.
	       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
	          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
	          reasonably practicable.

	  b. ShareAlike.

	     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
	     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

	       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
	          license with the same License Elements, this version or
	          later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

	       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
	          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
	          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
	          context in which You Share Adapted Material.

	       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
	          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
	          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
	          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


	Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

	Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
	apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

	  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
	     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
	     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
	     only;

	  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
	     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
	     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
	     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
	     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

	  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
	     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

	For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
	replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
	Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


	Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

	  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
	     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
	     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
	     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
	     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
	     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
	     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
	     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

	  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
	     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
	     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
	     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
	     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
	     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
	     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
	     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

	  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
	     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
	     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
	     waiver of all liability.


	Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

	  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
	     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
	     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
	     terminate automatically.

	  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
	     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

	       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
	          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
	          violation; or

	       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

	     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
	     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
	     of this Public License.

	  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
	     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
	     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
	     will not terminate this Public License.

	  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
	     License.


	Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

	  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
	     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

	  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
	     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
	     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


	Section 8 -- Interpretation.

	  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
	     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
	     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
	     be made without permission under this Public License.

	  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
	     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
	     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
	     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
	     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
	     conditions.

	  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
	     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
	     Licensor.

	  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
	     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
	     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
	     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.

	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
	      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.

	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and

	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and

	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.

	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

       APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
          boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
          replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
          the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
          comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
          file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
          same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
          identification within third-party archives.

	1.  **Adapted Material**  means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
	2.  **Adapter's License**  means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
	3.  **BY-SA Compatible License**  means a license listed at  [creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses](https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses), approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
	4.  **Copyright and Similar Rights**  means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section  [2(b)(1)-(2)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s2b)  are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
	5.  **Effective Technological Measures**  means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
	6.  **Exceptions and Limitations**  means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
	7.  **License Elements**  means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.
	8.  **Licensed Material**  means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
	9.  **Licensed Rights**  means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

	11.  **Share**  means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
	12.  **Sui Generis Database Rights**  means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
	13.  **You**  means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License.  **Your**  has a corresponding meaning.

	**Section 2 – Scope.**

	1.  **License grant**.
	    1.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
	        1.  reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
	        2.  produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
	    2.  Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
	    3.  Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section  [6(a)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6a).
	    4.  Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section  [2(a)(4)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s2a4)  never produces Adapted Material.
	    5.  Downstream recipients.

	        1.  Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
	        2.  Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
	        3.  No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

	    6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section  [3(a)(1)(A)(i)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1Ai).
	2.  **Other rights**.

	    1.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
	    2.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
	    3.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

	**Section 3 – License Conditions.**

	Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

	1.  **Attribution**.

	    1.  If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

	        1.  retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
	            1.  identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
	            2.  a copyright notice;
	            3.  a notice that refers to this Public License;
	            4.  a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
	            5.  a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
	        2.  indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
	        3.  indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
	    2.  You may satisfy the conditions in Section  [3(a)(1)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1)  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

	1.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section  [2(a)(1)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s2a1)  grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
	2.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section  [3(b)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3b); and
	3.  You must comply with the conditions in Section  [3(a)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a)  if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

	1.  This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

	    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section  [6(b)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6b)  does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

	3.  No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
             publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
             Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.

	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and

	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and

	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.

	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

             9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	      and conversions to other media types.

	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.

	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and

	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and

	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.

	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                       GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


      This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
    the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
    License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

    0. Additional Definitions.

      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
    General Public License.

      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
    other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
    by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
    Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
    of using an interface provided by the Library.

      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
    Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
    with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
    Version".

      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
    Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
    for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
    based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
    object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
    and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
    Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

      You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
    without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    2. Conveying Modified Versions.

      If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
    facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
    that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
    facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
    version:

       a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
       ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
       function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
       whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

       b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
       this License applicable to that copy.

    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

      The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
    a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
    code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
    material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
    layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
    (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

       a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
       covered by this License.

       b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
       document.

    4. Combined Works.

      You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
    taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
    portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
    the following:

       a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
       the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
       covered by this License.

       b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
       document.

       c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
       execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
       these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
       copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

       d) Do one of the following:

           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
           License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
           suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
           recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
           the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
           manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
           Corresponding Source.

           1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
           Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
           a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
           system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
           of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
           Version.

       e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
       be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
       GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
       necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
       Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
       Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
       you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
       the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
       Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
       Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
       for conveying Corresponding Source.)

    5. Combined Libraries.

      You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side by side in a single library together with other library
    facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
    License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
    choice, if you do both of the following:

       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
       conveyed under the terms of this License.

       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
       is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
       accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
    applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that published version or of any later version
    published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
    received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

      If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
    whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
    apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
    permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
    Library.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
             as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:

             (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

             (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                 stating that You changed the files; and

             (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                 the Derivative Works; and

             (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                 as modifying the License.

             You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
             may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
             reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
             the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
             any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
             by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
             this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
             the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
             with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
             names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
             except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
             origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
             agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
             Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
             WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
             implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
             of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
             risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
             whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
             unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
             negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
             liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
             incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
             Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
             other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
             has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
             the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
             and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
             or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
             License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
             on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
             of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
             incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
             of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
